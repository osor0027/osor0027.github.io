# Description of My portfolio
I was thinking this portfolio since I started college. I know that wiht the time I will be doing some changes, because there some things that I didnâ€™t know how to do yet, but I will try to do it on my own time. I'm glad we had the opportunity to actually make it real!
This portfolio contains some works that I did in my responsive web design class, it also has my Information and the rate of every app or programming languages that I know or that I want to learn. 
# Challenges 
I faced a lot of challanges when using bootstrap combine whit CSS, but I got used to it. I was difficult to use the boostrap navigation bar and then try to change some things from it; I needed to change the color from my XD design.
# What I learned 
I learn a lot of things, one of them was that I need to have in mind the code part when designing on XD. I also learnd how to take advantage from bootstrap for creatin a better layout.
